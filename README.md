## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites give you only the most superficial data about your stock portfolio as a whole. They typically give you your current holdings in shares and in dollars and they typically give you your last-day and lifetime performance. It is all simple math, and it is all useless for managing a portfolio. This is because the funds needed to purchase any new shares or to raise cash must always come from doing some selling somewhere else. Therefore, individual investors must always have some way to compare positions to each other if they are to make informed allocation decisions.

Unfortunately, stock positions are inherently quite different. And there is no single magic formula that can guide an investor on what to buy and what to sell based on how he or she is currently invested. But by framing the portfolio holdings data in the following ways, many more actionable, apples-to-apples comparisons can be made:

  * Useful position size data includes:
      * ("the past") **your cost basis** instead of just the current value
      * ("the present") **relative fraction of portfolio value** instead of absolute share or dollar counts
      * ("the future") **capital at risk**, adjusted by a stock-specific volatility number, instead of assuming equally-volatile stocks

  * Useful performance data includes:
      * **gains in percentages** instead of in dollars
      * **gains relative to the broad index** instead of absolute gain
      * **multiple timeframes** like short, medium, and long, instead of just daily gain or position lifetime gain

This big-picture portfolio perspective helps an investor level a diverse collection of stocks and purchase histories so that he or she is aware of all outsized bets and risks at all times.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management tool. Stock selection is easy because their returns are quoted in multiple timeframes and against the index. And once stocks have been selected, the app's flexible tagging feature combined with its many balancing options will tell you exactly how many shares of each stock to buy or sell based on your balancing objective.
