## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites surface only the most superficial portfolio data. It's all simple math, and it is all useless for managing a portfolio. But truly useful portfolio insights are the big-picture, apples-to-apples ones:

  * Position sizes should be compared with each other. Relative costs and relative values matter more than per-share numbers.
  * Position performance should be measured against a broad-based index. And time frames should be changeable. Daily performance does not matter.
  * Balancing tools should be available to everyone.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management. It shows positions as percentages of total value, total basis, and total risk, AND it provides balancing tools to balance to these metrics
