## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites surface only the most superficial data about your portfolio. Most sites present position data that are simple math based on shares, and they present performance data that is only over the "today" and/or "lifetime" timeframes. These numbers are all useless for managing a portfolio. 

Because deciding the amounts of each stock to own is a zero sum game, opportunity cost is unavoidable. Therefore, *everybody* needs asset allocation tools that can compare wildly different stocks and existing positions. And for truly meaningful comparisons, the following tenets are a good start:

  * When sizing positions, 
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages of the total portfolio communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in shares or dollars do.
      * **cost bases matter**. Balancing to value without also considering the basis can lead to unintentionally making too many investments in certain stocks and not enough in others.
      * **risk matters**. If we want equal downside, then we must consider the inherent volatility of each stock when we set position sizes.

  * When assessing performance,
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages gained communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in dollars do.
      * **multiple benchmark timeframes matter**. Timeframe importance is subjective. Therefore, investors need some way to assess the short term versus the long term of each position.
      * **the performance of the broad index matters**. Portfolio performance relative to the index is the bottom line for whether we should be investing in individual stocks at all.

This big-picture perspective helps to level a diverse collection of stocks and purchase histories where more apples-to-apples comparisons can be made.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management tool. Its flexible tagging feature combined with its many balancing options will tell you exactly how many shares of each stock to buy or sell based on your balancing objective. But more important is its high-level framing of the data; it clearly compares each position to each other and to the benchamark index using percentages, and it also presents each position's value in terms of total versus basis versus risk.
