## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites give you only the most superficial data about your stock portfolio as a whole. They typically give you your current holdings in dollars and shares and then for performance they tell you the lifetime gain. It is all simple math, and it is all useless for managing a portfolio. This is because the funds that are needed to increase a position must always come from trimming back other positions. Yes, comparisons are unavoidable. And so, fundamentally, all individual investors need tools that will compare their positions to each other.

Unfortunately, stock positions are inherently quite different. Investments are made in different amounts on different dates and the underlying securities themselves have a wide range of performance and volatility to them. However, by framing an investor's portfolio holdings data in the following ways, many more actionable, apples-to-apples comparisons can be made:

  * For useful position size data, your holdings should be shown to you with:
      * **your cost basis -** Basis reveals just how big that current value number started at.
      * **relative fractions of your portfolio value -** Fractions are more immediately comparable than shares and dollars are.
      * **your capital at risk -** Each position has its own downside in dollars, because no two positions have the same volatility.

  * For useful performance data, your holdings should be shown to you with:
      * **your gains in percentages -** Percentages are more immediately comparable than gains in dollars are.
      * **multiple timeframes -** Having short, medium, and long numbers snapshots the growth over standardized calendar time windows.
      * **gains relative to the broad index -** Gains relative to the index (aka: "alpha") are an investor's ultimate scorecard. Absolute gains are only half-truths.

This big-picture portfolio perspective helps an investor level a diverse collection of stocks and purchase histories so that he or she is aware of all outsized bets and risks at all times.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management tool. Quick portfolio decisions can be made because every position's data is framed by the metrics above. And in addition, the following two features save the investor from doing even more back-of-the-envelope math before buying and selling stocks.

  * **aggregate positions -** A flexible position tagging interface allows these same metrics to be calculated on aggregate for any combination of positions.
  * **many balancing objectives -** A robust balancing engine makes it so that any aggregate group of positions can be balanced either by basis or by current value, while also adjusting for cash, for risk, and for liquidated positions if desired. The output of the balancing operation is the exact number of shares of each stock needed to be bought or sold to achieve the desired balance.
