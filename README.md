## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites surface only the most superficial data about your portfolio. Position data are all simple math based on shares, and performance data are either just for today or for the position lifetime. These numbers are all useless for managing a portfolio. Truly useful portfolio insights are the big-picture, apples-to-apples ones:

  * When sizing positions, 
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages of the total portfolio communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in shares or dollars do.
      * **basis matters**. Balancing to value without also considering the basis can lead to unintentionally throwing good money after bad.
      * **risk matters**. If we want equal downside, then we must consider the inherent volatility of each stock when we set position sizes.

  * When assessing performance,
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages gained communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in dollars do.
      * **multiple benchmark timeframes matter**. Investors need some way to assess the short term versus the long term of each position.
      * **the performance of the broad index matters**. Position performance relative to the index is the bottom line for whether we should be investing in individual stocks at all.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management tool. Its flexible tagging feature combined with its many balancing options will tell you exactly how many shares of each stock to buy or sell based on your balancing objective. But more important is its high-level framing of the data; it clearly compares each position to each other and to the benchamark index using percentages, and it also differentiates value versus basis versus risk.
