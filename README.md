## ComparingStocks

Most financial websites give you only the most superficial data about your stock portfolio as a whole. They give you your current holdings in shares and in dollars of value and they give you your performance for both the current day and since the position was opened. It is all simple math, and it is all useless for managing a portfolio. This is because the funds needed to purchase any new shares or to raise cash must always come from some selling somewhere else. Positions must be comparable to each other if they are to be useful in making operational decisions.

Unfortunately, positions and their underlying stocks are inherently quite different. But to create more actionalbe, apples-to-apples comparisons, the following tenets are a good start :

  * When sizing positions, 
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages of the total portfolio communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in shares or dollars do.
      * **cost bases matter**. Balancing to value without also considering the basis can lead to unintentionally making too many investments in certain stocks and not enough in others.
      * **risk matters**. If we want equal downside, then we must consider the inherent volatility of each stock when we set position sizes.

  * When assessing performance,
      * **relative numbers matter**. Numbers presented as percentages gained communicate comparisons more immediately than numbers in dollars do.
      * **multiple benchmark timeframes matter**. Timeframe importance is subjective. Therefore, investors need some way to assess the short term versus the long term of each position.
      * **the performance of the broad index matters**. Portfolio performance relative to the index is the bottom line for whether we should be investing in individual stocks at all.

This big-picture perspective helps to level a diverse collection of stocks and purchase histories where more apples-to-apples comparisons can be made.

In all, **ComparingStocks** attempts to be a long-term portfolio management tool. Its flexible tagging feature combined with its many balancing options will tell you exactly how many shares of each stock to buy or sell based on your balancing objective. But more important is its high-level framing of the data; it clearly compares each position to each other and to the benchamark index using percentages, and it also presents each position's value in terms of total versus basis versus risk.
